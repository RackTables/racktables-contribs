    * commend-edit utility for editing comments on racktables directly from server
    * service tag
    * supermicro exeption for service tag (my supermicro servers has all same ST and Expres ST. I don't know why)

    * Interface Connection (LLDPD needed for this feature. System automaticly link server interfaces with switch ports in RackTables)

TODO

    * support for other virtualization technologies (OpenVZ, KVM)
    * test script on various linux distributions and BSD installations
    * Linux Virtual Server shared IP catalogization
    * better discovery of physical interfaces
