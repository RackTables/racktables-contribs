From bug #556...

<snip>
Hi,

we're currently building a capistrano based deployment process for racktables.

To upgrade the database from the console, i've developed a small php console application which can do the upgrade from the console. The application uses Composer and the Symfony2 console.

To use it:

  Install composer:
    $> curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer [^] | php
  Install dependencies:
    $> php composer.phar install
  Run the console:
    $> php console.php
</snip>
