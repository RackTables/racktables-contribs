# Quickstart

Note that this isn't a production setup, but fairly close. Make sure to change
the configuration if you intend to use it in production.

    docker-compose up
    # Start by browsing to http://localhost/?module=installer&step=5

# Configuration

Look at the env vars available in the `Dockerfile` and `entrypoint.sh`.
