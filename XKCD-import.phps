/*
 * UPDATE: This revision of script can run with RackTables 0.19.x.
 *
 * XKCD (xkcd.com) is a relatively popular webcomic, which is licensed under
 * Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License. This script
 * imports files with XKCD art into RackTables system. The files are taken
 * from a local mirror of XKCD archive, if there is one.
 *
 * First, it is necessary to get the files themselves. It was possible
 * earlier to do that with a single wget pass:
 * $ wget -r -A png http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/
 * However, after changes on the XKCD server more work is necessary:
 * $ wget --mirror --level=2 --span-hosts --domains=xkcd.com,imgs.xkcd.com --accept=html,jpg,png http://xkcd.com/archive/
 * There should be several hundred PNG and JPEG pictures in the imgs.xkcd.com/comics
 * directory after that. (There are other XKCD ripping scripts available
 * on the Internet.)
 *
 * Second, two variables below ($imgdir and $racktables_root) must be set
 * according to local filesystem layout. After that the script can be
 * executed from command-line (php XKCD-files.php) to import the files.
