yaml_import:
Author: Tommy Botten Jensen <tommybjensen@gmail.com>


The plugin uses the autogenerated .yaml files from puppet to create objects in racktables.
It has been tested with puppet 0.25.x and racktables 0.18.4. And feedback/changes are always welcome.

Installation:
- Copy the yaml_import.php and the bundled spyc.php file into the inc/ folder of racktables.
- Create a folder 'yamls' in the racktable root directory. This is where you put your YAML files.
- Add 'include yaml_import.php' to your inc/local.php -file
   - You can link to puppets yaml folder (which by default is /var/lib/puppet/yaml/node)
   - Or nfs mount it.
   - or rsync... etc.

In use:

After logging into racktables, you can reach the import tab from the "Objects"-section. You will see a tab marked 'import'.
Here you will see a list that shows all hostnames from the .yaml files with the ones not represented in racktables database
marked as red.



Known issues:
- The plugin is name centric. If you change a hosts name, it will seem like a entirely new object to racktables. It will also fail because of identical IPs, nics and so forth. The "unique" identifier in puppet uses hostid which is not unique at all.

- The application doesn't do input sanitation and has not been tested for SQL injections or filesystem scan attacks. You must, however be logged in to gain access to the import plugin.
