Patchnotes:
Aded capability with Racktables 0.20.3
"long2ip" replaced with functions from functions.php ("ip4_bin2int", "ip4_int2bin", "ip4_format")

The plugin uses fping to ping through a subnet reporting on hosts which reply to
ICMP ping. It lists IP allocation, name and response for ech IP giving you a way
of verifying your network map.

Note that the racktables instance must be able to reach the IPs with ICMP ping
for this plugin to be useful.

This work was heavily based upon the work done on live PTR records.


Installation:
- Copy the ping.php file into the plugins folder of racktables.
- Install the fping from your favorite repository
- Adjust the ping timeout variable in ping.php if needed.

In use:
After installation, log into racktables and access a IPv4 network instance and
click on the "Ping overview" tab. Here you will be presented with a list of IPs
and their respective names, ICMP ping responses as well as a stats overview.

Known issues:

- The application doesn't do input sanitation and has not been tested for SQL
injections or filesystem scan attacks. You must, however be logged in to gain
access to the import plugin.

- Since fping is done in serial, a run through a huge network will be slow. It
takes about 6 seconds for a /24 network, and 12 for a /23 network. As far as I
can see it seems to scale linearly.


Caveats:
- I could not find any way that the regular linux ping (iputils package) could
have a sub second timeout. This is why fping is needed. Its easy to change it
to use any tool such as regular ping, nmap etc.

- Even if you have set pagination active the entire subnet will be scanned for
each time you change page.
